# Cricket API üçî

Live Cricket Score API üèè

unofficial API Data Fetched from `Cricbuzz.com`

This is an unofficial API and not Linked or Partnered with Any Brands/Company.

## How it Works? ü§î

We are just fetching the data from Cricbuzz using PHP cURL `preg_match` and `preg_math_all`. It's kind of scraping but we are not storing any data or link in our end.

Everything is scraped live and shown to end users in realtime.

## Requirements üìë

- Server with PHP Support  
- PHP 7.2 or 7.3 or 7.4  
- PHP cURL  
- Nginx, Apache2 or  Lightspeed  
- HTTPS (For Secure SSL Connections)  

## Installation üçØ

- Download or Clone Repo to your Server

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mskian/cricket-api.git
```

- Install the API Separately on your server
- Download or clone the script in `/var/www/`
- Server Root Directory Pointed to script folder (Different on Some Hostings and server)

```sh
/var/www/cricket-api/cri ## Script Folder
```

## Usage üçü

- Get the Live Match Score URL from - `https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-match/live-scores`
- Enter them Directly or replace `www` with `m`

### Example

```sh
https://cri.example.com/cri.php?url=https://www.cricbuzz.com/live-cricket-scores/30524/53rd-match-indian-premier-league-2020
```

(OR)

```sh
https://cri.example.com/cri.php?url=https://m.cricbuzz.com/live-cricket-scores/30524/53rd-match-indian-premier-league-2020
```

## Code Examples ‚òï

- WordPress

```php
## API Auth and Get data
function display_api_response() {
  $base_url = 'https://YOUR-API-Domain.com/cri.php?url=';
  $score_path = 'https://www.cricbuzz.com/live-cricket-scores/30524/53rd-match-indian-premier-league-2020';
  $url = $base_url.$score_path;
  $response = wp_remote_get($url);
  global $body;
  $body = json_decode( $response['body'], true );
}
add_action( 'init', 'display_api_response' );
```

Replace `YOUR-API-Domain` with your actual API Domain

var url = 'https://www.cricbuzz.com/live-cricket-scores/30524/53rd-match-indian-premier-league-2020';

async function fetchscore() {

        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/cri.php?url=' + url);
        const data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (exception) {
        console.log('Connection issue');
    }

fetchscore();
