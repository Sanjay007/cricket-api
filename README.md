# Cricket API üçî

Live Cricket Score API üèè

unofficial API Data Fetched from `Cricbuzz.com`

This is an unofficial API and not Linked or Partnered with Any Brands/Company.

## How it Works? ü§î

We Just Fetch the Certain data from Cricbuzz using PHP cURL `Preg_match` and `preg_match_all` in other word we can say this as Scraping but here we not store any data's or link the Cricbuzz in our Script.

We Just access the Live Score URL via cURL & Get the Certain data's from the Webpage.

- Server with PHP Support  
- PHP 7.2 or 7.3 or 7.4  
- PHP cURL  
- Nginx, Apache2 or  Lightspeed  
- HTTPS (For Secure SSL Secure Connections)  

## Installation üçØ

- Download or Clone Repo to your Server

```

- install the API Separately on your server
- Download or clone the script in `/var/www/`
- Server Root Directory Pointed to script folder (Different on Some Hostings and server)
